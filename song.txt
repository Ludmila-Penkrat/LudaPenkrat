Babe don't try to call
My heart is ticking and the show, just won't wait
 
My love, diamond rings and Chevrolets
My love, acess high and cigarettes
My love, faking all like Hollywood
My love, love, love

No way you'll see me crowl
Like a shark I'll be ripping you apart, and celebrate
With lots of champagne, you caught me on the wrong day, now you know

Came what may, I won't give away

My love, see me dancing in the rain
My love, no more whiskey and cocaine
My love, ending all forbidden fruit
My love, love, love
